<p>I’m talking about Georgia the country, not the deep south. 
Today I had the opportunity to try a new tea blend coming straight from Georgia from a company called Gurieli. I was curious to see how a tea from a Soviet country like Georgia would taste.</p>

<p>The flavor was every smooth and the Jasmine was quite light, even after steeping it for more than just a few minutes. I think many will come to appreciate this flavor. The taste is hard to describe - it feels closer to Jasmine than anything, but it definitely is not the same kind of Jasmine tea that you would find at a dim sum restaurant in Chinatown.</p>

<p>Apparently, the leaves for this tea come from the mountains of Racha, Georgia. It is my first time drinking tea from this region. I like it though and I find this tea to be soothing!</p>
