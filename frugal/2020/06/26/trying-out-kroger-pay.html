<p>Kroger pay is a app-based contactless payment method for certain Kroger stores in the US. It generates a one-time use QR code that gets scanned when you check out. It helps customers make payments for their purchase more smoothly. While Kroger stores still don’t accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, select Kroger stores have rolled this out since 2019.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kroger_pay.jpg" height="240" /></p>

<h2 id="how-kroger-pay-works">How Kroger pay works</h2>
<p>Customers first need to download the Kroger Pay app, or an app of a Kroger store, such as QFC. Then, they can link it to a major credit, debit or prepaid card.</p>

<p>Once you install the app and enter your payment info, you can use it as simple as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Kroger Pay app</li>
  <li>Enter your custom PIN or use FaceID</li>
  <li>Scan the presented QR code to complete your purchase</li>
</ol>

<p>The QR code has the added benefit of also automatically communicating your loyalty or rewards card information, so it can help you save more.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-using-kroger-pay">Benefits of using Kroger Pay</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contactless payment, which is very important in the times of COVID-19</li>
  <li>You don’t have to carry around your wallet or credit cards</li>
  <li>Skip entering your rewards card info, since it’s automatically done by the app</li>
  <li>You can use virtual prepaid debit cards, which typically can’t be used for physical grocery shopping.</li>
  <li>Fun fact! You might get more credit card rewards through Kroger Pay. For example, the Bank of America Cash Rewards card codes Kroger Pay transactions as Online Shopping, though YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have Kroger pay set up on your phone, it is quick, safe and very convenient.</p>
